## Call Scala Native from Java using FFM

Demonstration project for my [blog post](https://blog.indoorvivants.com/2025-02-16-scala-native-from-java-via-ffm).

Uses Scala CLI.

Run with `make run`. 

Other commands will require both [jextract](https://github.com/openjdk/jextract) and [sn-bindgen](https://sn-bindgen.indoorvivants.com/) to be installed.
